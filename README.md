# Task List

## User Story

>As a developer, I was tasked to create a "Note Taker" application that can write and save notes or tasklists. Using Express.js, I created a server on the backend that has the capabilities to retrieve notes from JSON file and stored/saved with unique "id's." I then connected the backend to frontend to the deploy on Heroku to make a live functioning app.

## Acceptance Criteria

>User is presented a task list note taker application.
When accessing the application, the user will begin using the app by clicking "Get Started."
The link will open to a page where user will be presented two columns.
The right column is where a title and specific notes can be typed into the field.
When completed it can be saved by clicking on the save icon in the top right corner of the navigation bar.
Once saved it will appear in the list on the far left column.
When the tasks or notes are completed or no longer needed there is a delete icon next to the task that can be clicked.
